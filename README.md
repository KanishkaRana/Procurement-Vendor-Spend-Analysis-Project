# Procurement-Vendor-Spend-Analysis-Project
Project Title: IT Procurement & Vendor Spend Analysis


 Overview

This repository contains the Python code and resources for the IT Procurement & Vendor Spend Analysis project. This project is designed to identify cost-saving opportunities, optimize vendor relations, and provide strategic visibility into technology spending for large organizations.

The core of the system involves Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) complex transactional data from raw logs and visualizes the key findings and performance metrics via an interactive Power BI dashboard.

✨ Features

Data Ingestion: Reads and processes raw transactional data from various procurement systems (e.g., CSV exports).

Data Transformation (Python/Pandas): Performs complex data cleaning, standardization, and normalization to create a robust analytical model.

KPI Calculation: Derives key performance indicators such as Spend by Category, Contract Compliance Rate, and Vendor Consolidation Index.

Dashboard Visualization (Power BI): Publishes interactive reports to enable C-level stakeholders to drill down into spend patterns.

Vendor Segmentation: Identifies top-tier and underperforming vendors based on volume, value, and compliance metrics.

📊 Dashboard & Results

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the system's performance and the key insights derived from the data.

Key Dashboard Components:

Total Spend Over Time: Displays time-series analysis of quarterly or monthly IT expenditures to spot trends and seasonality.

Vendor Performance Matrix: Visualizes spend allocation across top vendors and highlights contract compliance issues.

Category Drill-Down: Interactive charts enabling users to filter spend by IT category (e.g., Software, Hardware, Services).
